# GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards 📚✨

A simple, single-screen Android application designed to help you study GRE vocabulary words efficiently. This personal project focuses on a clean, distraction-free flashcard experience with a toggle for dark mode.

## Features 🚀

*   **📇 Streamlined Flashcard Interface:** View one word at a time in a focused, single-screen layout.
*   **🤔 Reveal Meanings On-Demand:** Test your knowledge by trying to recall the meaning first, then reveal it with a button press.
*   **⬅️ ➡️ Easy Navigation:** Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to move through your word list seamlessly.
*   **🌙 Dark Mode Support:** Toggle between light and dark themes to reduce eye strain, especially during late-night study sessions.

## Project Scope 🎯

This application was developed as a **personal utility tool** for GRE preparation. It is intentionally kept simple and is not intended to be a large-scale, feature-rich commercial app. The primary goal is to provide a functional and straightforward way to study vocabulary.

## Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas) 💡

While the app is currently functional for my needs, here are some ideas for future improvements:
*   🔀 Add a shuffle mode to randomize the order of words.
*   🎯 Allow users to mark words as "difficult" for later focused review.
*   📊 Implement a scoring system to track progress.
*   ✏️ Enable users to create and manage their own custom word lists.
*   🔉 Add audio pronunciation for each word.
